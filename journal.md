# 12:12 AM, 7/12/2025 - Oh Dear

Riley: idk what the heck i'm doing but as of now ðŸ¦„ is somewhat CADded. Used calipers to measure Orpheus Pico and this will fit an Orpheus Pico

# Somewhere between 12-4am, 7/12/2025 - Suffering
Riley: Tried to get the ADXL345 to work with the Orpheus Pico, code was able to run but only gave back 0,0,0. Tried it with Arduino Uno R4 Minima new error because library wasn't updated to work with the R4 or some reason, additional issues were mainly no available M-M Jumper Wires since wires we tried to use likely weren't making any connection. Spliced 2 and made 2 M-M wires out of available wires. Went to sleep due to the tedious nature around 3am <br>
Sonit: Trying to get ADXL345 working, reviewed online resources

# 7am-10am. 7/12/2025 - It kinda works??
Sonit: Got the ADXL345 to work after switching to the WEMO d1 Mini and using a different library, working on Fruit Ninja and interfacing with the computer <br>
Riley: Worked a bit more on CAD
